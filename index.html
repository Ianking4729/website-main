          <p>
            My name is Ian Kingori, and I’m a 19-year-old student at North Carolina A&T State University. While I’ve spent most of my life in Charlotte, North Carolina, my roots trace back to Kenya, a beautiful country in East Africa. I’m passionate about video editing and graphic design, hobbies that allow me to express my creativity and attention to detail. A fun fact about me is that I pride myself on being both highly creative and open-minded, always eager to explore new ideas and perspectives.</p>

                  I used HTML/CSS to create a personal website and graphic design tools for marketing materials. I also managed cost estimation and financial planning for a small business using Excel. Through the Career Explore program, I visited four major companies—<b>Ally Bank, Duke Energy, Lowe’s, and Red Ventures</b>—to job shadow, explore internships, and learn about company culture and Employee Resource Groups. This experience helped me improve professionalism, communication, and workplace skills for career growth in corporate America.

          <p>For my Kenyan community, I volunteer as a mentor for youth, creating opportunities for them to learn and grow in the tech field. I organize and lead coding workshops that focus on teaching foundational programming languages like HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and Python, while also fostering creativity and practical application. Many of the youth I've worked with have successfully built beginner-level personal websites using these skills. Currently, I'm collaborating with the youth I've mentored to develop a website for our community, which will serve as a hub for resources and connections. My goal is to empower the next generation to explore and excel in technology while giving back to the community that shaped me.</p>
